# Discord Ollama bot

- written in rust

- this bot is still very early in development so keep that in mind, currently
  not intended for other people to use and is only for my own specific discord
  bot, eventually i will refactor the code, clean it up and will be available
  for other people to use

note: currently requires an environment variable for the bot token, I am using a
nix shell to achieve this for now.

## features:

- [ ] basic functionallity and settings (get to a state where i can replace this
      with a previous one i made in python)
- [ ] add nix development shell (for those 0.001% of nix users who might use
      this)
- [ ] save system using json
- [ ] unhardcode a bunch of stuff (add customizability)
- [ ] refactor
- [ ] add option to change bot settings purely via discord commands for
      convinience
